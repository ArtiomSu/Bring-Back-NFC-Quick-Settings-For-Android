# Bring-Back-NFC-Quick-Settings-For-Android

Android 12 removed quick settings toggle for NFC so this app adds an nfc toggle in the style that matches the other system quick settings.

# Install
After installing the app there is nothing you can open/launch all you need to do is add the quick settings tile by clicking the pencil edit and dragging the new tile.
